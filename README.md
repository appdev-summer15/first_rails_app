## Fortune Teller

Our very first Rails app. Our goal will be to allow the user to take two actions:

### Go to `/lucky_numbers`

When users go to `/lucky_numbers`, they should see their five lucky numbers for the day. These numbers will be randomly chosen.

### Go to `/zodiacs/:sign`

Add a list of nav links to `/zodiacs/leo`, `/zodiacs/cancer`, etc.

Make those routes work to display individual fortunes.
